# donut.rs

Variation of [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html),
implemented with orthographic camera, SDF, & raymarching, and
using a sphere's normals to approximate.

# tri.rs

Draws a triangle, rotating in the range [-1,1]. Fun.

Formatting the code was done by scripts, and all files can be compiled w/ `rustc -O <file>`.
